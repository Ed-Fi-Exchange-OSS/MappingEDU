# MappingEDU

UNSUPPORTED. NO LONGER AN ACTIVE PROJECT

MappingEDU is a web-based system designed to assist users in mapping one data
standard to another. Originally provided as a hosted service by the Ed-Fi
Alliance, the service is being retired in 2022 and the source code opened to the
community under the terms of the [Apache License, version 2.0](LICENSE).

## Technical Debt Warning :exclamation:

This web application was built using AngularJS, a front-end development
framework created and later abandoned by Google. The application uses the latest
available version of AngularJS. However, it should be noted that this framework
is no longer under support. If there are any obscure bugs - including
security-related ones - then they will not be fixed.

Additionally, there are many other small bugs that linger in the code, because
they were edge cases whose resolution  the Alliance could not prioritize.

If any users discover and correct a bug, please submit a pull request. Because
this is an unsupported product, the Alliance might not merge the pull request.
However, any other user will then see the fix and be able to apply it in their
own fork of the code.
