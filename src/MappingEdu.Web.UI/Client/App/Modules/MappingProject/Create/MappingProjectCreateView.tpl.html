    <h2>Create New Mapping Project</h2>
    <p>
        Give your Mapping Project a name, and select source and target Data Standards for
        your project. Any Standard can be a source or target, but there are a few differences.
        Here are a few hints to guide your choice:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The Data Standard you select as the "source" is the queue for the project, which works
            like a punchlist. The system treats the elements in the source as a to-do list, with the
            mapping project complete after all elements have had business logic entered.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you're mapping to the Ed-Fi Data Standard, the source Data Standard typically refers
            to the schema from your internal organization, and the Ed-Fi Data Standard is usually the 
            target.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you're mapping to CEDS elements, CEDS is typically set up as the source, though the CEDS 
            Export report will be formatted correctly whether CEDS is the source or target.
        </li>
    </ul>
