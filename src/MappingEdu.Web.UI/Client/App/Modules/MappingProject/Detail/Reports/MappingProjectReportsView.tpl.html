            The Mapping Review Report is the main output from this system. It
            exports all mappings between the source and target Data Standards
            as well as a current status, notes, and so forth. You can run this
            report any time. The report is generated in Microsoft Excel.

        <p>
            The Target Standard Punchlist provides a list of elements in the target Data Standard
            with an indication of whether or not they have been mapped. This can be useful, for
            example, when the target Standard is a report or data submission for which every
            element needs to be mapped.

            If you need this report, you probably already know what it is: the CEDS initiative
            encourages standards bodies to map their data standards to CEDS elements. This export
            is a file that can be uploaded to the mapping site at ceds.ed.gov. As you'd expect,
            this special-purpose report only appears on Projects where CEDS is one of the Standards 
            being mapped.
