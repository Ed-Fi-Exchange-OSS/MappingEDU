                The Unified Data Dictionary is a flat file generated off the Ed-Fi Data Standard to improve
                transparency on the location, definition, and requirement specification of all data elements.
                This report can be utilized to better understand the inner workings of the data standard and
                provide assistance for any outside entity working on aligning their schema to an existing
                Ed Fi version.
